# Capstone | Salt & Hash

_Tinder-inspired event venue voting app_

Created by a team of developers during the [Grace Hopper Program](https://www.gracehopper.com/) at Fullstack Academy, Salt & Hash is an iOS/Android app that allows friend groups to vote on restaurants for organized events. 

Hosts create an event, select restaurants in their nearby location, and invite friends to RSVP and vote over text; invited guests register for an account, and cast their votes on a host’s selected restaurants. Once the voting deadline passes, a restaurant is listed for the event.
